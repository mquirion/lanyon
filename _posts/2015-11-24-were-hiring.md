We’re building a team! Come solve complex IoT problems with me at Leverege! A 
definite “full stack” opportunity! Let me know if you’re interested! Leverege is currently looking for a direct hire engineer with a couple 
of years experience to work across the full stack of our IoT Application
 Enablement Platform. This is a great opportunity for a motivated 
engineer to get in early and use technologies like Kafka, Google 
BigTable, Apache NiFi, ReactJS, and web sockets. Reach out if you would 
like to be the next engineering addition to our growing team!

<p>Have you ever heard of the adoption curve?  I first really became aware of it in a 100-level marketing class in college.  It&rsquo;s something most everyone inherently knows, but marketing researchers really put a name to it and then started diagramming it. It looks something like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://31.media.tumblr.com/2faca9dae7daeedc325e0cc51fb5f390/tumblr_inline_mzzgiuwY1U1qbth3q.png"/></p>

<p></p>
<p>The curve represents the typical adoption of a good or service by customers.  The &ldquo;Innovators&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Early Adopters&rdquo; are the first folks attracted to something new.  You probably know at least a few of these folks.  They&rsquo;re always up on the latest music, fashion, TV shows, tech, whatever.  These are the ones who pre-ordered the first-generation iPad after telling you it was coming for a year.  They knew Ska was big before Swingers was released. They&rsquo;d had a cronut before lines even started forming. And sometimes (often) they adopt things that never take off, like Laser Discs or the Apple Newton. Maybe they bought a Segway without owning a city touring service.</p>
<p>Then there are people like me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost always part of the &ldquo;early majority.&rdquo; And I&rsquo;m almost always in the very early front of that majority.  I didn&rsquo;t get the 1st iPad.  I did get the 2nd generation iPad a week after it was released though.  I&rsquo;m not among the first 1000 users of Twitter, but I was using if way before mainstream media was trying to do stories about how you could explain it to your mom.  I was a &ldquo;foodie&rdquo; maybe a year before everyone was a &ldquo;foodie.&rdquo;  You get the picture.  I&rsquo;m rarely at the forefront of anything in pop-culture, but I can usually see it from where I&rsquo;m standing, waiting to be convinced that the early-adopters aren&rsquo;t just off on another wild goose-chase in their Segways.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a perceived split between Innovators/Early-Adopters and the Early Majority that many folks call &ldquo;The Chasm.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s the great distance a product/service/pop-icon must cross over in order to go from a niche player that the few love to the mainstream, money-making success that everyone knows and wants.  I&rsquo;ve noticed something about myself: If I&rsquo;m doing it, using it, listening to it, or watching it, whatever &ldquo;it&rdquo; is has probably only <em>just</em> crossed that Chasm.  Had I the stomach to play individual stocks, I&rsquo;d watch myself more closely and play the stocks of the things I just fell in love with. Of course, I&rsquo;d probably ruin the effect then.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s something I just did that I think might be worth noting, given I so often sit on the side of the Chasm with my feet dangling: <strong>I bought a 2nd tablet. </strong> Not as a replacement for the trusty iPad. Not even as an &ldquo;upgrade.&rdquo; I got it because I could see more need for another tablet; Nothing fancy - just a tablet.</p>
<p>So I bought a <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/7/">Nexus 7</a>. It&rsquo;s gotten very good reviews and it&rsquo;s inexpensive. Yeah, it&rsquo;s Android rather than iOS, but it&rsquo;s not full of bloatware like other non-iOS devices.  And besides, I&rsquo;ve still got my iPad. When that finally dies, then we&rsquo;ll probably get another iPad.  We&rsquo;re too invested in the iTunes media empire not to do so.  But right now I don&rsquo;t need or want another iPad.  <em>I just wanted another tablet</em>. So, Nexus 7 it is.</p>
<p>Given my tendencies to walk with the vanguard of the early-adopters army, I have to at least wonder if that might mean something about the tablet market in general.  My first purchase of a tablet wasn&rsquo;t a purchase of a <em>tablet</em>. I was buying an <em>iPad</em>.  I practically got goose-bumps as I handed over my debit card at the Apple Store the day I bought it.  I couldn&rsquo;t wait to see what possibilities lay before me.  I couldn&rsquo;t wait to show it off to people I knew who still didn&rsquo;t have one. I had something others might covet: an iPad! 2! It was embarrassingly thrilling.</p>
<p>But last night I just wanted another tablet.</p>

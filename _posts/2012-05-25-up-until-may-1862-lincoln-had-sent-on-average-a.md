title: Up until May 1862 Lincoln had sent, on average, a little over one telegram
  a month. But things changed when a telegraph office was opened next door to the
  White House, in the War Department. On May 24 the president had his online breakout,
  sending nine telegrams. That week he would send more than all his previous messages,
  combined. From May 24 — 18 years to the day since Morse had first tapped out “What
  hath God wrought” — forward, Lincoln and the telegraph were inseparable. The new
  telegraph office became the first Situation Room. Several times a day the president
  would walk into the telegraph office, sit down at the desk of its manager and begin
  going through the copies of all telegrams received, whether addressed to him or
  not. During great battles the president would even sleep in the telegraph office,
  just to be close to his oracle.

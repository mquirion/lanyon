<p>With relatively rare exception, I turn on my television and my DirecTV box every night to see &ldquo;what&rsquo;s on.&rdquo; Note that I&rsquo;m rarely turning it on with &ldquo;appointment tv&rdquo; in mind. I&rsquo;m almost always disappointed. Who could blame me? For about $90 a month, I pay DirecTV for the privilege of taking up about 85% of my DVR space with <em>Sesame Street</em>, <em>Super Why</em>, and <em>Dino Train</em> for the kids (all from PBS). And as an added bonus, the best thing I&rsquo;ll see on TV that entire week might be something like <em>The Killing</em> - a show that (ask any of its regular viewers) clearly hates its audience.  This sort of behavior is unhealthy, but more importantly to me, it&rsquo;s bad economics.  Near as I can tell, I&rsquo;m paying about $90 a month for about 300 channels that almost never interest me, so I&rsquo;m ending that now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of discussion about consumers &ldquo;cutting the cord&rdquo; from cable and dish television providers. Yesterday <a href="http://takemymoneyhbo.com/">an entire site dedicated to a sort of social-media form of petitioning HBO for a  stand-alone HBOGo cropped up</a>.  And recently, during the All Things Digital 10 conference, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/1/3057275/ari-emanuel-this-is-where-i-work">quite the kerfuffle was made over various comments by Hollywood super-agent Ari Emanuel</a> that essentially boiled down to &ldquo;ala carte models wont work&rdquo; and &ldquo;people don&rsquo;t want to pay for anything.&rdquo;  And along with that, he made a lot of misinformed comments about magical anti-piracy technology that the likes of Google could and should implement if they were really willing to help protect his industry. (Yep, his biggest angle was protectionism.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of numbers on the subject lately, and the ones I tend to believe more tend to support the argument that the &ldquo;old models&rdquo; of Hollywood are dying, but I&rsquo;ll grant that those holding the opposite opinion have their own data too.  Instead, I&rsquo;d rather just speak to my own logic for deciding to cut the cord from these old models of televised entertainment.  When it comes to money I spend on entertainment, I&rsquo;m seeking value.  When I&rsquo;m connected to the old model via a cable or dish subscription, I&rsquo;m paying money for entertainment that&rsquo;s ostensibly available 24/7. If I turn the TV on at any hour, there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m paying for displaying on the television. Of course, whether or not it&rsquo;s actually entertaining or informative is an entirely different question - one that&rsquo;s often answered with a resounding &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  So in essence, I&rsquo;m paying $90 a month to have by-and-large non-entertaining, non-informative noise pushed to me, whether I&rsquo;m trying to receive it or not.  What&rsquo;s worse, when I do just give up on trying to find something compelling to watch, but choose to watch &ldquo;something dumb&rdquo; on television using the old model, I&rsquo;m paying for it both with my subscription money and my <em>time</em>. And time&rsquo;s my most valuable resource in this equation by far. Cable and dish network television make it entirely too easy to waste my resource of time.</p>
<p>So instead, I&rsquo;ll save that $90 bucks a month, and use services like Netflix to provide childrens&rsquo; entertainment when I (God help me) want to have the kids watch tv.  Luckily we&rsquo;ll still have PBS available as well - <em>Sesame Street</em> is actually <em>better</em> today than it was when I was a kid.  And for my own entertainment, I&rsquo;ll be using things like Apple TV to occasionally purchase things I really want to watch, like the <em>Game of Thrones</em> series.  At a pure, per-unit rate, such viewing might cost me more, but at least I&rsquo;ll feel like I&rsquo;m getting some sort of value for both my money and my time, and I&rsquo;m not subsidizing things like <em>Operation Repo</em> on truTV.  I don&rsquo;t even really know what either one of those things is, but I know I don&rsquo;t want to help pay for it.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a warning to all the moving picture content companies seeking to protect their old business models.  It comes with no malice or ill intent: I am not the consumer type you want to dismiss. I am not an early adopter. I&rsquo;ve never pirated a single movie. Throughout my life, from AOL to broadband, from Napster to Spotify, from wine appreciation to craft brews, I&rsquo;ve proven to be part of the &ldquo;early majority.&rdquo; If I&rsquo;m making the move, it might not yet be too late to change your models, but it will be before too long.</p>
<p>This evening, while scanning Twitter and not watching TV, I saw this tweet re-tweeted many times over&hellip;</p>

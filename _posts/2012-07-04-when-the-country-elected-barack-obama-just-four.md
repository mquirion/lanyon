  When the country elected Barack Obama just four years ago, Twitter was a fledgling startup. During the campaign, Obama overtook Kevin Rose as the most followed person on Twitter, passing him at 56,482 followers.

  Five years ago, according to Pew, less than half of Americans used email daily; less than a third used a search engine.

  YouTube was founded in 2005 and Facebook in 2004 — and it would be a while after that until they became such integral parts of our day-to-day Internet experience.

  Today nearly half of Americans own a smartphone. The iPhone is five years old.

Sometimes you have to stop and look back to appreciate the rush.

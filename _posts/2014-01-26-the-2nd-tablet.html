title: The 2nd Tablet
---

<p>Have you ever heard of the adoption curve? &nbsp;I first really became aware of it in a 100-level marketing class in college. &nbsp;It's something most everyone inherently knows, but marketing researchers really put a name to it and then started diagramming it. It looks something like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/2faca9dae7daeedc325e0cc51fb5f390/tumblr_inline_mzzgiuwY1U1qbth3q.png" /></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The curve represents the typical adoption of a good or service by customers. &nbsp;The "Innovators" and the "Early Adopters" are the first folks attracted to something new. &nbsp;You probably know at least a few of these folks. &nbsp;They're always up on the latest music, fashion, TV shows, tech, whatever. &nbsp;These are the ones who pre-ordered the first-generation iPad after telling you it was coming for a year. &nbsp;They knew Ska was big before Swingers was released. They'd had a cronut before lines even started forming. And sometimes (often) they adopt things that never take off, like Laser Discs or the Apple Newton. Maybe they bought a Segway without owning a city touring service.</p>
<p>Then there are people like me.</p>
<p>I'm almost always part of the "early majority." And I'm almost always in the very early front of that majority. &nbsp;I didn't get the 1st iPad. &nbsp;I did get the 2nd generation iPad a week after it was released though. &nbsp;I'm not among the first 1000 users of Twitter, but I was using if way before mainstream media was trying to do stories about how you could explain it to your mom. &nbsp;I was a "foodie" maybe a year before everyone was a "foodie." &nbsp;You get the picture. &nbsp;I'm rarely at the forefront of anything in pop-culture, but I can usually see it from where I'm standing, waiting to be convinced that the early-adopters aren't just off on another wild goose-chase in their Segways.</p>
<p>There's a perceived split between Innovators/Early-Adopters and the Early Majority that many folks call "The Chasm." &nbsp;It's the great distance a product/service/pop-icon must cross over in order to go from a niche player that the few love to the mainstream, money-making success that everyone knows and wants. &nbsp;I've noticed something about myself: If I'm doing it, using it, listening to it, or watching it, whatever "it" is has probably only <em>just</em> crossed that Chasm. &nbsp;Had I the stomach to play individual stocks, I'd watch myself more closely and play the stocks of the things I just fell in love with. Of course, I'd probably ruin the effect then.</p>
<p>But here's something I just did that I think might be worth noting, given I so often sit on the side of the Chasm with my feet dangling: <strong>I bought a 2nd tablet.&nbsp;</strong> Not as a replacement for the trusty iPad. Not even as an "upgrade." I got it because I could see more need for another tablet; Nothing fancy - just a tablet.</p>
<p>So I bought a <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/7/">Nexus 7</a>. It's gotten very good reviews and it's inexpensive. Yeah, it's Android rather than iOS, but it's not full of bloatware like other non-iOS devices. &nbsp;And besides, I've still got my iPad. When that finally dies, then we'll probably get another iPad. &nbsp;We're too invested in the iTunes media empire not to do so. &nbsp;But right now I don't need or want another iPad. &nbsp;<em>I just wanted another tablet</em>. So, Nexus 7 it is.</p>
<p>Given my tendencies to walk with the vanguard of the early-adopters army, I have to at least wonder if that might mean something about the tablet market in general. &nbsp;My first purchase of a tablet wasn't a purchase of a <em>tablet</em>. I was buying an <em>iPad</em>. &nbsp;I practically got goose-bumps as I handed over my debit card at the Apple Store the day I bought it. &nbsp;I couldn't wait to see what possibilities lay before me. &nbsp;I couldn't wait to show it off to people I knew who still didn't have one. I had something others might covet: an iPad! 2! It was embarrassingly thrilling.</p>
<p>But last night I just wanted another tablet.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m officially posting longer thoughts in text here on tumblr rather than on <a href="http://mattq.posterous.com/">my previous Posterous site</a> starting now.  Ultimately it doesn&rsquo;t really make much difference to me, as all of my rambling gets pulled down out of this service (and any other I use), and saved to my personal data store.  You can see a great deal of that data on a stream over at my personal site: <a href="http://www.mattquirion.com">mattquirion.com</a>.  That&rsquo;s sort of the point of my data-store.  I can use whatever &ldquo;in&rdquo; service is currently, um, &ldquo;in,&rdquo; get all the &ldquo;social&rdquo; benefits of being where the crowd is, and get to keep whatever data is important to me, even after that &ldquo;in&rdquo; service becomes &ldquo;out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To integrate my data storing service with tumblr, I used a the tumblr API to request the data.  It&rsquo;s returned in JSON format, and ruby (the language I used to build my personal site) makes it a relative breeze to parse out what&rsquo;s relevant to me.  Took about 45 minutes to work out and lay into my app.</p>
<p>I will need to figure out exactly how to display the non-text posts from Tumblr on my personal site, but I&rsquo;m not even sure I care to do it.  It&rsquo;d just mean data running through my server.  For now, anything I&rsquo;d really want seen by others can be displayed perfectly fine (and probably prettier) on tumblr, so I&rsquo;m happy to let it be.</p>
<p>Got lots of ideas for posts coming up.  It&rsquo;s a fun time with big ideas in the tech world.</p>

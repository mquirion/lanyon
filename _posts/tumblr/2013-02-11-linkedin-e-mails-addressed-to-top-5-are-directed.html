<p>There&rsquo;s been a ton of conversation in social media circles about <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/feb/11/linkedin-top-5-percent-club">LinkedIn&rsquo;s new marketing campaign</a>.  LinkedIn has been notifying users that they&rsquo;re among the top 5% (and even 10%, now) of viewed profiles on the social network.  Some mentions of the campaign bemoan it. Other mentions seem to make attempts at a &ldquo;humble brag&rdquo; about it. And still others seem to genuinely think it&rsquo;s pretty cool.  But what I love about the campaign is that these e-mail notifications aren&rsquo;t aimed at the receivers of the e-mails at all.  These congratulatory messages are targeted at the LinkedIn users who aren&rsquo;t getting them.</p>
<p>One of LinkedIn&rsquo;s most valued assets is the data it possesses about each of its registered users.  As of January 2013, <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2013/01/09/linkedin-200-million/" target="_blank">LinkedIn has 200 Million registered users</a>.  Most of them have at least indicated their current career situations and probably their work history.  But there&rsquo;s so much more a registered user can do with their profiles, accounts, and activities. And as LinkedIn constantly likes to imply while it encourages those activities, doing these things could help a user&rsquo;s career.</p>
<p>So when 2(0) Million LinkedIn users start talking about the congratulatory e-mails they&rsquo;ve received about the interest in their profiles (which, presumably, has some notion of career benefit attached), it leaves the other 95% who never received such an e-mail to wonder: What can I do to enhance my profile on LinkedIn and help my own career?  After all, even after people realize 5% of 200 million is 10 million, the other 95% must ponder what they&rsquo;re failing to do to be among that massive pool of &ldquo;better&rdquo; profiles.</p>
<p>LinkedIn&rsquo;s answer: Add more data about yourself and get more active on their social network. (Read: Give us more data.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a brilliant move.  It&rsquo;s Judo Marketing.  And yet I can&rsquo;t help but recall <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/i-am-a-brand-pathetic-man-says,30545/" target="_blank">this Onion&rsquo;s piece on &ldquo;personal branding&rdquo;</a> even as I enjoy this gambit.</p>
